## Project management

The project was developed using the Kanban Agile management methodology and the MoSCoW prioritisation technique.

It was put in place using different functionalities in GitHub: 
* Issues, for EPICS and user stories;

An epic covers the development of an existing feature in the API.

User stories were linked to the epic to keep track of the progress with the tasks.

In order to better organise the flow of the work to do, I also created an epic for the set up and final deployment of the project.

* Milestone (without due date), for the product backlog;

Ready-for-development epics were stored in the product backlog before starting a sprint.

* Milestone (WITH due date), for each iteration;

I worked 1 epic x sprint.
User stories that couldn't be completed were placed back in the product backlog and on "No status" category of the project for eventually being included in a next sprint.

* Project, for the Kanban board.

Both the Urban-drf and  Urbantrip repositories were linked to the same project, Urbantrip-PP5.

Labels were used to identify epics and user stories of each repo.

Epics were assigned to the "To-do" status and move to "In progress" or "Done" status as the tasks in the user stories were completed.
