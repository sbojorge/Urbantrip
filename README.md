# Urbantrip

## Project goal

UrbanTrip is a content sharing platform for city trip lovers. Among the main features users can share pictures and videos of their favorite cities, comment on posts, follow other users and more.

The website is responsive in the most common screen devices (smartphone, tablet, laptop and desktop) and within the following width categories:

* 320 x 480px
* 768 x 1024px
* 1280 x 802px
* 1600 x 992px

![responsive](/readme/images/UI/picture_1.png)

Please visit the deployed site by clicking on [Urbantrip](https://urbantrip-a9f84fe92f01.herokuapp.com/).

## Project management

The project was developed using the Kanban Agile management methodology and the MoSCoW prioritisation technique.

It was put in place using different functionalities in GitHub: 
* Issues, for EPICS and user stories;

An epic covers the development of an existing feature in the web application.

User stories were linked to the epic to keep track of the progress with the tasks.

* Milestone (without due date), for the product backlog;

Ready-for-development epics were stored in the product backlog before starting a sprint.

* Milestone (WITH due date), for each iteration;

I worked 1 epic x sprint.
User stories that couldn't be completed were placed back in the product backlog and on "No status" category of the project for eventually being included in a next sprint.

* Project, for the Kanban board.<br>
You can access the project [here](https://github.com/users/sbojorge/projects/12).
This project holds epics of 2 repositories: Urban-drf (the backend repo) and Urbantrip (the frontend repo).

Both, the Urban-drf and  Urbantrip repositories, were linked to the same project: Urbantrip-PP5.

Labels were used to identify epics and user stories of each repo.

Epics were assigned to the "To-do" status and move to "In progress" or "Done" status as the tasks in the user stories were completed.

<!-- add epic and user stories here following the same schema as urbandrf as possible -->

## Design
### Database structure
UrbanTrip follows the database schema as its backend API, Urban-drf.<br>
You can review it [here](https://github.com/sbojorge/Urban-drf), in the corresponding repository.

### Wireframes
Wireframes are created for sketching the UI ideas.<br> The final project may be slightly different. The wireframes of this project are:
- Landing web page

    ![landing-web](/readme/images/mockups/picture_1.png)
- Landing mobile app

    ![landing-mob](/readme/images/mockups/picture_2.png)
- Home web page

- Contact web page

    ![contact-web](/readme/images/mockups/picture_7.png)
- Contact mobile app

    ![contact-mob](/readme/images/mockups/picture_8.png)

### Typography
The font combination for the project was chosen in this blog article: https://connectivewebdesign.com/blog/best-google-font-combinations

![typography](/readme/images/UI/picture_2.png)

This combination goes well with the intrinsic modern look of this project as well with photographies which are at the heart of this web application.

### Colours
The colour palette was chosen for its contemporary style.<br>
The palette was created using the [Canvaâ€™s color palette generator](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) and one of the avatars from the [unDraw illustrations collection](https://iconduck.com/sets/undraw-illustrations) at [iconduck](https://iconduck.com/).<br>
Canva used the hues in the avatar to create the palette.

### Features
#### Existing features
React applications are made up of components.<br>
A component is a JavaScript file that handles one functionality, for instance, a navigation bar, a sign in page etc. And can be nested inside other components for more complex situations e.g in this project the ServiceDetail, ServiceContactDetails and the ReviewsPage components are nested in the ServicePage component for rendering in the UI a service offering including the offerer contact details and the users reviews and ratings.

Components can also be reused within the same application or in external applications.<br>
These components were reused for developing this project:
1. Avatar.js, which displays the user's profile image. This component can be found nested in:
  - the NavBar component, for the stating the user's status<br>
for showing the ownership of post, comment, service and review in:
  - Post.js
  - Comment.js
  - Service.js
  - Review.js
2. ControlsDropdown.js, used for displaying the edit and delete options in:
  - posts (Post component)
  - comments (Comment component)
  - in the user profile through the use of the ProfileEditDropdown function
  - in services (Service component)
3. Asset.js, that is used to display a spinner, an image and/or a message in different situations:
  - while fetching data from the backend, e.g, in the PostsPage and ServicesPage components
  - nested within the NotFound component for displaying an image and appropiate message
4. DeleteConfirmation.js, which has been used in the same components as the ControlsDropdown component (except in the Profile one as profiles can't be deleted from the UI).
More about this component in the "Credits" section.

These other components could be easily used in other applications:
- NavBar.js
- ContactCreateForm.js

Thus, each existing feature in UrbanTrip was built creating, developing and reusing components.<br>
Below I'll present and explain each of them:

***Home page (unauthenticated users)***

When users navigates to the UrbanTrip's url, they arrive to the home page for unauthenticated users.
This page corresponds to the PostsPage component. Three other components are nested within: the Post, the PopularProfiles and the Asset component.
They will be explained separately later.
<br>

As rendered in large devices:<br>

![home-deskt](/readme/images/features/picture_1.png)

Here users can see the most popular profiles, the existing posts and scrolldown to keep loading posts.<br>
The navigation bar and the search bar are available as well.

Unauthenticated users can perform searches, visit profiles listed in "Most popular profiles" and read the existing comments on a post.

In this home page, posts display its number of "likes" next to a heart icon and its number of comments next to a conversation icon.
The liking and commenting functionalities however are reserved to authenticated users.
One is informed about it thanks to tooltips when hovering over the "Like" and "Comments" icons.

![tooltip-like](/readme/images/features/picture_2.png)

![tooltip-comment](/readme/images/features/picture_2A.png)

***Navigation bar***

The navigation bar is available in all pages except in the authentication pages.
Its content changes according to the user status.

For unathenticated users, the navigation bar shows the UrbanTrip logo,which has a link to the home page, and the sign in and sign up links.
The current page is highlighted to the user: 

![navbar-deskt](/readme/images/features/picture_3.png)

On small devices the navbar collapses into a hamburguer icon:

![navbar-tab](/readme/images/features/picture_4.png)

![navbar-tab-op](/readme/images/features/picture_5.png)

For authenticated users, the content of the navigation bar, besides the logo and home link, is as follows:
 - Create
 - Feed
 - Liked
 - Services
 - Contact
 - Sign out
 - Signed in as (so the current status of the user is evident)

![navbar-loggedin](/readme/images/features/picture_9.png)

***Authentication (Sign in and Sign up pages)***

By clicking on the sign in link and/or the sign up link redirects the user to the corresponding page.<br>

![authentication](/readme/images/features/picture_6.png)

If there is any error in the provided credentials, the user is informed so he/she can take action:

![authentication-1](/readme/images/features/picture_7.png)

![authentication-2](/readme/images/features/picture_8.png)

***Home page (authenticated users)***

After successful signed in, users are redirected to the home page.<br>
Users can find the same elements as prior to the sign in, but the functionality of some of them is extended: 
- the navigation bar displays more links as previously mentioned
- the "Most followed profiles", which displays the content of the PopularProfiles component, has now the "Follow" and "Unfollow" buttons for the following functionality

    ![mfp-loggedin](/readme/images/features/picture_10.png)

- liking and commenting are now enabled

***The search bar***

Authenticated or unauthenticated users can research posts by city, country, title and username.

![search-hp](/readme/images/features/picture_13.png)

if there isn't any corresponding result, the Asset component, nested in the PostsPage, is rendered to give feedback to the user:

![search-nr](/readme/images/features/picture_13A.png)

***The PopularProfiles component***

This nested component brings to the UI the result of a filter set in the backend: profiles in descendent order of the number of followers.

In small screen devices the number of displayed popular profiles is 4.

A user can follow another by simply clicking on the "Follow" button.
The button will then be changed to "Unfollow" to let the user stop following the other user.

The count of followed users (namely "following") and of followers is available in the user profile.

A user's profile can be reached by clicking on the profile image on the left of the "follow"/"unfollow" button.

***The Post component***

Recalling,the home page renders the PostsPage component: all the existing posts are rendered here.

A post is the content of the Post component, also nested in the PostsPage, and displays:
- the Avatar component, which provides the profile_image of the post owner
- the username of the post owner
- the date of the last update of the post
- the image/video uploaded by the user
- the title of the post
- the description/content about the post
- the number of likes and comments

![post](/readme/images/features/picture_12.png)

Posts behaves differently depending on if the user is the owner or not of the post.
For owners, the 3 dots menu is available in the post (PostPage), but not for the other users.
If a user that isn't the owner tries to reach the posts/:id/edit page via the url, he/she will be redirected to the home page.

***Post CRUD: Create a post***

Clicking on the "Create" link on the navigation bar renders the PostChooseMedia component.

![create-post](/readme/images/features/picture_14.png)

After clicking on the kind of post of his/her choice, a form for creating the post is rendered to the user: **PostCreateFormPicture**.js or **PostCreateFormVideo.js**.<br>
As both components are pretty similar, this section will explain only the one for uploading a picture.

![create-form](/readme/images/features/picture_15.png)

After uploading the image, a "Change the image" button is available in case the user would like to change for another file.

![create-filled](/readme/images/features/picture_15A.png)

By hitting "Save" the post is created, the number of post is incremented by 1 in the ProfilePage and the PostPage component displays the newly created post.

![create-filled](/readme/images/features/picture_15B.png)

***Post CRUD: Edit and Delete a post***

Only owners of a post can edit/delete a post. 

Click the menu to display the options.

![post-menu](/readme/images/features/picture_15C.png)

When editing, the PostEditForm component is rendered. All fields of the form can be updated: image/video (files can be replaced only by the same type of file), title and content.

When deleting, the DeleteConfirmation component is called.<br>

![delete-confirmation](/readme/images/features/picture_15D.png)

User can abort the deletion by clicking on "cancel", he/she will be redirected the last visited page, or proceed by clicking on "confirm deletion", in which case the user is redirected to the home page.
Deleting a post decreases the number of posts by 1 in the ProfilePage component.













#### Features to be implemented
In the future, I'd like to improve this web application by:

- Adding the "Password forgotten" feature.
- Adding different choices of avatar for the profile (man, woman, pride, etc).
- Displaying the profile image and username in the "Like" feature and not only the number of likes.
- Displaying the profile image and username in the "Followers" and "Following" stats in the profile.
- Adding notifications to be sent to the user when their posts have been liked/commented.

 ## Testing

 Follow this link for the documentation related to [tests](/TESTING.md)

## Control version

The site was created using GitPod as editor and pushed to Github to the remote repository urbantrip.

### Early deployement
The web site was early deployed at the beginning of the development following these steps:
#### Repository and workspace
1. Create an empty repository (with no template) in GitHub and name it using lowercase letters as this is required for React apps.
2. In the repository, click the "GitPod" button to create a new workspace.
3. In the workspace, create a React app using the command npx create-react-app with a space and full stop at the end as shown: 
**npx create-react-app .**
This will ensure to create the app in the root directory.
4. Run the command **npm start** to check that the app is working.
5. Commit and push the code to GitHub.
#### Heroku app
1. In your Heroku dashboard, click on the "New" button in order to create a new app.
2. Name your app and select a region according to your location place.
3. Click on the "Create app" button.
4. In your newly created Heroku app, click on the "Deploy" tab.
5. Between the deployment methods, click on "GitHub", enter the name of your repository<br>
If found, a link to the repository will be displayed.
Click the "Connect" button.
6. For automatic deployments after each push to GitHub, scroll down the page and click on the "Enable automatic deploys" button.
7. To finish, click on the "Deploy branch" button.<br>

The app was successfully deploy at first attempt.

#### Connect the backend API with the React application
The Urbandrf backend API should accept requests from the Urbantrip application.
In order to achieve that the following steps were taken:
1. In the urbandrf app on Heroku, click on the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the Config Vars section.
2. Click on "Reveal Config Vars" and create two variables: CLIENT_ORIGIN and CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV.
3. Assign values for each variable as:
	- CLIENT_ORIGIN: the Heroku app url of the React app;
    - CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV: the GitPod url of the React app;

![configvars](/readme/images/deployment/picture_1.png)

4. In order for React to send requests to the API, install the axios library.
5. In the src folder, create the api folder and then an axiosDefaults.js file inside it.
6. Import axios at the top of the file.
7. Define the baseURL, which will be the url of the urbandrf API.
8. Set the content-type header to multipart/form-data as the application will be dealing with  images as well as text in its requests. 
9. Set withCredentials to true for avoiding any CORS errors when sending cookies.

![axios](/readme/images/deployment/picture_2.png)

10. Finally, export the axiosDefaults.js file to the App.js component.<br>


The backend, urbandrf, and the frontend, urbantrip, got connected since the first attempt.

### Final deployment
These are the steps to follow for the final deployment of the application:
1. In index.js, remove the <React.StrictMode> component as this is only need during development.<br>
IMPORTANT: Keep the comma after the Router component:

    ![strictmode](/readme/images/deployment/picture_3.png)

2. In package.json, in the scripts section, add this command:**heroku-prebuild: npm install -g serve**.
3. Create a Procfile on the root directory and add the web command:**web: serve -s build**
4. Save all changes and push your code to GitHub.
5. In Heroku, as the automatic deploys were enabled during the early deployment, check that the app has been deployed.
6. Click on the "Open app" button.<br>

The application was succesfully deployed at first attempt. 

### Forking

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

- Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.

- On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.

- This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.

### Cloning

Cloning is used to create a local copy of the repository created in GitHub.
Both, the local copy and the remote are syncronized.

- Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone.

- Above the list of files, click Code.

There are 3 possibilities for copying the URL of the repository: HTTPS, SSH key and GitHub CLI.
I'll develop the one that I use.

- Click the HTTPS tab and copy the URL.

- On your machine, open your text editor, go to the Command palette and click on Git Clone.

- Past the URL, hit enter and choose a folder to save the repository.
